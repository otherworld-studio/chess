  <h1 align="middle">Introduction</h1>
  
  <p>This page is meant to document and explain the process of creating a simple 3D chess game in the Unity Engine. I assume the reader will have some level of familiarity with C# programming, as well as some knowledge of basic Unity terminology as well as the rules of chess. However, I hope that it may still serve as a beginner-friendly guide to making games in Unity as well as an inspiration for similar games in the future. The end result can be experienced right here:</p>

  <h1 align="middle">Part I: The Board</h1>

  <p>When choosing how to represent the game board itself, it will be useful to stick to implementations that are isolated from the Unity engine. This approach has at least two benefits:
    <ul>
      <li>We can easily create new Board objects without risking any unintented effects in the Unity scene. This might come in handy if we ever create an opponent AI that needs to make copies of the game board.</li>
      <li>We can easily migrate the code to any related future projects.</li>
    </ul>
  Therefore, create a new C# file with a Board class, but do not have it inherit from MonoBehaviour. We will not be attaching it to any GameObjects. Add another public class, Square, as a member of Board. Each square has a "rank" and a "file", its vertical and horizontal positions on the board. Because every chess board is a square with 64 Squares, we can create and store all of these Squares at the beginning using a static initializer, and provide public access to them through static methods.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Next, create an abstract class, Piece, as a private member of Board. Each type of piece (pawn, knight, etc.) will inherit from this class. We want Piece to be a member of board so that it has access to Board's private members. I'll further explain this choice later on, but the gist of it is that each type of piece is responsible for deciding how it will affect the Board. We also want Piece to be private as it will eventually have public methods that modify a Board object, and only a Board object should be able to call them.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  We have Pieces and Squares, but how do we actually keep track of the location of each piece on the board? In other words, how should we map between Squares and Pieces? Here are some options:
  <ul>
    <li>Give each Piece a Square member denoting its location on the board.</li>
    <li>Give each Square a Piece member denoting its current occupant.</li>
    <li>Make a size-64 array of Pieces, storing the piece at every position (or null if the square is empty).</li>
    <li>Some combination of the above?</li>
  </ul>
  TO BE CONTINUED...</p>
